# NetGarde

**Self-hosted network security platform** — secure VPN access, DNS policy enforcement, real-time monitoring, behavior analytics, and optional AI-assisted operations.

Built end-to-end: React dashboard, FastAPI backend, WireGuard enrollment client, host-level enforcement agents, and AWS production deployment with CI/CD.

## Overview

Most network security tools are either enterprise appliances with heavy lock-in, or consumer DNS blockers with no real visibility. NetGarde sits in between: a **self-hosted SASE-style stack** you operate on your own infrastructure.

Clients enroll over **WireGuard**. DNS flows through a central policy engine (dnsmasq + custom sync). The dashboard streams live queries over **WebSocket**, scores per-device behavior against baselines, and can quarantine clients at the network layer (iptables + DNS deny). Optional **LLM summaries** (OpenAI or Ollama) explain network and device state — detection stays rules-based.

The system is deployed on **AWS** (EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront, ECR) with GitHub Actions pipelines, structured CloudWatch logging, and a deliberate **container vs. host** split for WireGuard and dnsmasq operations.

## Platform at a glance

| Capability | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| Secure access | WireGuard VPN, device enrollment API, IP pool allocation |
| DNS policy | Policy packs, per-device profiles, schedules, geo/country rules |
| Real-time monitoring | WebSocket live feed, Redis-backed throughput charts |
| Behavior intelligence | Per-device baselines, abnormal scoring, auto-block |
| Enforcement | Host agent (iptables quarantine), dns-sync → dnsmasq reload |
| AI operations | Network overview + behavior review (template / OpenAI / Ollama) |
| Production ops | Structured JSON logs → CloudWatch, Alembic migrations, ECR deploy |

## Architecture

NetGarde runs as a **control plane on EC2**. Application logic lives in Docker; network enforcement runs on the host — containers cannot safely mutate WireGuard, iptables, or dnsmasq.

| Layer | Components | Responsibility |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Edge clients** | Laptops, phones, enrolled devices | DNS and traffic via WireGuard tunnel |
| **EC2 host** | WireGuard, dnsmasq, iptables | VPN termination, DNS resolution, quarantine |
| **Host agents** | `netgarde-wg-agent`, `netgarde-log-watcher` | Peer apply, block/unblock, log ingest, policy sync trigger |
| **Application** | FastAPI, dns-sync, React (S3/CloudFront) | Policy engine, REST + WebSocket API, admin UI |
| **Data** | PostgreSQL (RDS), Redis, ECR | Policy state, live usage windows, container images |

**Request flows**

```
DNS:     Client → WireGuard → dnsmasq → log_watcher → API → WebSocket → Dashboard
Policy:  Dashboard → API → RDS → wg-agent → dns-sync → dnsmasq reload
Enroll:  NetGardeClient → POST /v1/enroll → wg-agent → WireGuard config
```

**Design decisions worth noting**

- **Generated dnsmasq config** — RDS is source of truth; config files are never hand-edited in production.
- **Selective DNS persistence** — Only blocked queries stored by default; full logging is opt-in (`PERSIST_ALL_DNS`).
- **Rules-based security, LLM for explanation** — Scoring and blocking are deterministic; AI summarizes for operators.
- **Feature-module monorepo** — Backend and frontend organized by domain (`policy`, `devices`, `dns_queries`, `vpn`).
