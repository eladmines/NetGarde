## Component overview

| Layer | Components | Role |
|-------|------------|------|
| **Clients** | Site router, laptops, phones | DNS traffic tunneled via WireGuard to EC2 |
| **EC2 host** | WireGuard, dnsmasq, iptables | VPN termination, DNS resolution, traffic blocking |
| **Host services** | `trustedge-wg-agent`, `trustedge-log-watcher` | Peer apply, quarantine iptables, DNS log ingest, trigger policy sync |
| **Docker** | FastAPI backend, dns-sync | API, policy computation, dnsmasq config generation |
| **AWS** | RDS PostgreSQL, S3, CloudFront, ECR | Persistent state, dashboard hosting, image registry |
| **Redis** | Usage samples (EC2) | Real-time VPN throughput for live charts |

## Data flows

### DNS query path

```
Client → WireGuard → dnsmasq → dnsmasq.log
                              → log_watcher → POST /dns-queries/bulk → Backend
                              → WebSocket → Dashboard (live feed)
                              → RDS (blocked queries only, by default)
```

### Policy enforcement path

```
Dashboard → Backend (policy / quarantine / client block)
         → RDS (source of truth)
         → wg-agent → iptables (quarantine) + run-sync.sh
         → dns-sync → GET /policy/dns-sync → dnsmasq conf → reload dnsmasq
```

### VPN enroll path

```
TrustEdgeClient → POST /v1/enroll → Backend → device + IP allocation
              → wg-agent POST /v1/apply-peer → WireGuard peer on host
              → WireGuard config returned to client
```

## Trust boundaries

| Boundary | Why it exists |
|----------|---------------|
| **Docker ↔ EC2 host** | Containers cannot mutate `wg0`, `iptables`, or reload host `dnsmasq` |
| **CloudFront ↔ Backend** | HTTPS termination; API proxied to EC2 :8000 |
| **Token scopes** | Admin, DNS ingest, wg-agent, and device tokens protect different surfaces |
